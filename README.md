# meteor-user-status

Keeps track of user connection state and makes this available in `Meteor.users` as well as some other objects.

## Usage

*You must have [Meteorite package manager](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite) installed to run the command below*
```sh
$ mrt add user-status
```

The `profile.online` field will be updated automatically if the user logs in or logs out, closes their browser, or otherwise disconnects.
 (anonymous users are not tracked.)

Use a reactive cursor, such as by creating a publication on the server:

```coffeescript
Meteor.publish "userStatus", ->
  Meteor.users.find { "profile.online": true },
    fields: { ... }
```

or you can use this to do things when users go online and offline (however, usually you should just be as reactive as possible):

```coffeescript
Meteor.users.find({ "profile.online": true }).observe
  added: (id) ->
    # id just came online
    
  removed: (id) ->
    # id just went offline
```

Or, if you are already pushing all users to the client, use a reactive template:

```coffeescript
Template.foo.usersOnline = ->
  Meteor.users.find({ "profile.online": true })
```

## Advanced Usage

The `UserSessions` (anonymous) collection contains a `userId` and `ipAddr` field for each logged in session (stored in `_id`).
You can use this to check the IP address of any connected user. We don't keep this in `Meteor.users` because that would
incur extra database hits and require unnecessary additional cleanup.

The `UserStatus` object is an `EventEmitter` on which you can listen for sessions logging in and out.
Logging out includes closing the browser; opening the browser will trigger a new login event.

```coffeescript
UserStatus.on "sessionLogin", (userId, sessionId, ipAddr) ->
  console.log(userId + " with session " + sessionId + " logged in from " + ipAddr)

UserStatus.on "sessionLogout", (userId, sessionId) ->
  console.log(userId + " with session " + sessionId + " logged out")
```

This will print out stuff like the following:
```
RsuCmaNLa6CXAR9dS with session t6acwNizuWuJdL8rC logged in from 192.168.56.1
Rrp6yezq9iZJhipg3 with session TPnT28aCnaQGzavay logged in from 192.168.56.1
Rrp6yezq9iZJhipg3 with session TPnT28aCnaQGzavay logged out
Rrp6yezq9iZJhipg3 with session XReS3mqDZEKD9tTKW logged in from 192.168.56.1
```
