  Apparently, the new api.export takes care of issues here. No need to attach to global namespace.
  See http://shiggyenterprises.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/meteor-packages-in-coffeescript-0-6-5/

  We may want to make UserSessions a server collection to take advantage of indices.
  Will implement if someone has enough online users to warrant it.
###
UserConnections = new Mongo.Collection("user_status_sessions", { connection: null })

statusEvents = new (Npm.require('events').EventEmitter)()

###
  Multiplex login/logout events to status.online

  'online' field is "true" if user is online, and "false" otherwise

  'idle' field is tri-stated:
  - "true" if user is online and not idle
  - "false" if user is online and idle
  - null if user is offline
###
statusEvents.on "connectionLogin", (advice) ->
  update =
    $set: {
      'status.online': true,
      'status.lastLogin': {
        date: advice.loginTime
        ipAddr: advice.ipAddr
        userAgent: advice.userAgent
      }
    }

  # unless ALL existing connections are idle (including this new one),
  # the user connection becomes active.
  conns = UserConnections.find(userId: advice.userId).fetch()
  unless _.every(conns, (c) -> c.idle)
    update.$set['status.idle'] = false
    update.$unset =
      'status.lastActivity': null
  # in other case, idle field remains true and no update to lastActivity.

  Meteor.users.update advice.userId, update
  return

statusEvents.on "connectionLogout", (advice) ->
  conns = UserConnections.find(userId: advice.userId).fetch()
  if conns.length is 0
    # Go offline if we are the last connection for this user
    # This includes removing all idle information
    Meteor.users.update advice.userId,
      $set: {'status.online': false }
      $unset:
        'status.idle': null
        'status.lastActivity': null
  else if _.every(conns, (c) -> c.idle)
    ###
      All remaining connections are idle:
      - If the last active connection quit, then we should go idle with the most recent activity

      - If an idle connection quit, nothing should happen; specifically, if the
        most recently active idle connection quit, we shouldn't tick the value backwards.
        This may result in a no-op so we can be smart and skip the update.
    ###
    return if advice.lastActivity? # The dropped connection was already idle

    Meteor.users.update advice.userId,
      $set:
        'status.idle': true
        'status.lastActivity': _.max(_.pluck conns, "lastActivity")
  return

###
  Multiplex idle/active events to status.idle
  TODO: Hopefully this is quick because it's all in memory, but we can use indices if it turns out to be slow

  TODO: There is a race condition when switching between tabs, leaving the user inactive while idle goes from one tab to the other.
  It can probably be smoothed out.

  # This will not be the most recent idle across a disconnection, so we use max

  # TODO: the race happens here where everyone was idle when we looked for them but now one of them isn't.
